This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
Forescribe Landing Page
A modern, responsive landing page built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
The project includes reusable components like a Logo, LoginCard, Card, a long card setup, and a functional Contact Us page using React Hooks.

ðŸ“¦ Features
âœ… Responsive design for all devices
âœ… Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
âœ… Components: Logo, LoginCard, Card
âœ… Functional Contact Us page with form handling via React Hooks
âœ… Image assets and data dynamically imported from /assets folder
âœ… Smooth animations using framer-motion
âœ… Organized and scalable code structure

# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project live.

ðŸ“‹ Assumptions Made During Development
The provided images and data (such as card content) are stored inside the /public/assets directory.

The data.js file inside the /public/assets/ folder exports an array of card data for the cards display.

The authentication buttons in the LoginCard (Google, Microsoft) are for design purposes only and are not connected to real OAuth services.

Form submission on the Contact Us page only logs the data to the console â€” no backend integration yet.

âœ¨ Additional Features & Improvements
Added animation effects to Cards and Buttons using Framer Motion.

Contact form uses React Hooks (useState and useEffect) for handling form data and live logging.

Design was optimized to be pixel-perfect with custom Tailwind utility classes.

Reusable and modular components to promote scalability for future pages.

Hover effects and transition animations for an interactive experience.

Framer Motion

React Icons

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
